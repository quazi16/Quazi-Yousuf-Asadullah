        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>For much of my life, I have been an avid reader. I dearly loved to read. The beauty with which words dance on paper is something that makes me feel alive.</p>
        <p> I have got reasons of my own for aspiring to wanting to establish a writing business. </p>
        <p><!--I dream of things I've never seen
The sunlight doesn't wait for me now-->
        <p>With dreamy eyes, I hope to reach up above. I can read the ocean as I write with the stars. </p>
        <p>My specialties as a writer include copywriting, content writing and/or ghostwriting.</p>
        
        <h3><strong>Experience</strong></h3>
        <p>Sit close,
let me tell me you every truth I know
Let me read you poetry and prose</p>
        <ul>

<li> Most importantly, I got to write content for Tortue Games, an emerging name in the card and board game industry.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Additionally, I've got experience writing content for greeting cards.

        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>Is it really alright to claim yourself as a programmer when you aren't that good at it?<br />
          <strong><em>But, hey I hope to make an AI and name it after my beloved someday. After all, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Fingers crossed.</em></strong> :3</p>
